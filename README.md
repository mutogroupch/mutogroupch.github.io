# mutogroupch.github.io
Muto GmbH, Switzerland, website

This site is hosted on https://pages.github.com/ .

So you can easily use Theme and Static Site generator like Jekyll ( https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll ) or Hugo , 
to comfortably edit your website in github webui as markdown files.

To have it as mutogroup.ch instead of https://mutogroupch.github.io/
one needs to make CNAME file and configure domain dns: 
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site .
